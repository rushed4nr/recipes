Ingredients
 - 1 large sheet of puff pastry dough or 1 tube of refrigerated crescent dinner rolls
 - 1 round or wedge of Brie cheese (do not remove rind)
 - Raspberry Jam, or other sweet jam
 - Brown sugar
 - 1/4 cup of maple syrup

Directions:
 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. If you want, start with chilled  brie and use a sharp knife to carefully cut off the thin top rind of the cheese. This may help the crust stay with the cheese when served. The rind is edible so you don't have to do this step if you don't want to.
 2. On a stick-free cookie sheet, lay out the puff pastry or the crescent rolls flat; put the brie round or wedge on top.
 3. Spread jam on brie, fold dough over top, cutting off excess dough. Drizzle maple syrup and place a handful of brown sugar on top.
 4. Bake at 350ยบ for 25-30 minutes, pastry should be golden brown. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Serve with crackers and apple slices.
